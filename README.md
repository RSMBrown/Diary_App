Diary app
Allow a user to authenticate themselves (sign up, sign in and sign out)
As a user I want to be able to create, update, delete, list and see (ie. CRUD) entries
The entries should show the date the entry was created, the entry text and feelings of that entry
The feelings are the following: happy, sad, neutral, excited, anxious, worried, ecstatic.
A user should only be able to see their own entries, not another users (hint: use the current user method in devise)
